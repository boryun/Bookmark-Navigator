# About

This is a chrome bookmark navigator extension which is modified from [Bookmark Navigator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-navigator/jnldllmpcebljljmihdlcoabgfcpbenp). I add some functionality to better meet my needs, and as a result (which I'm sadly confused about it), is that it start up much slower than original version :( .

Currently supported functionalities are:
 - Browse bookmark list and save last scrolled position.
 - Open all links within a folder (and optionally in new tab group).
 - Search bookmarks and display in tree view.
 - Edit links/folders by right click.
 - Reorder links/folders by drag and drop.
 - Create new sub-folder at right click menu (experimental).

To use it, simply download/clone this repository and load it in "chrome://extensions" page. As I'm just an amateur of JavaScript programming, any kinds of contribution (debug, optimization, refactoring, guidance, suggestion ...) are greatly welcome.
